# Sakura Collectibles – JavaScript in Practice
### This project is a front-end shopping cart simulation created to practice and demonstrate core JavaScript concepts applied to a real-world scenario.
### It represents a practical introduction to how JavaScript adds logic, interactivity, and dynamic behavior to a web application.
### The project simulates a fictional figure store, Sakura Collectibles, where users can browse products, add them to a cart, and see prices update automatically.

## Project Overview:
### The application is divided into two main parts:
#### Landing Page (Storefront): Displays collectible figures with images, names, and prices in a visually cute (kawaii :3) layout!
#### Shopping Cart Page: Allows users to add products, manage quantities, and view the total cost dynamically.
### The goal is to mimic the basic behavior of a real e-commerce cart while keeping the logic simple and easy to understand.

## How Does the Project Work?
### Users interact with the interface through forms and buttons.
### With JavaScript, the application:
#### - Adds selected products to the cart.
#### - Calculates the total price automatically.
#### - Updates quantities and values in real time.
#### - Clear the cart when needed.
#### - Provide visual feedback through dynamic UI updates.

### This project shows how small JavaScript features can significantly improve user experience and make a website feel more professional and functional.

## Technologies Used:
### This project was developed using the following web technologies:
#### HTML: Provides the structure and semantic layout of the pages.
#### CSS: Handles styling, layout, responsiveness, and visual identity (colors, animations, and UI consistency).
#### JavaScript: The core of the project! responsible for cart logic, calculations, user interactions, and dynamic updates.

# NOTES:
## This project was created for learning purposes and focuses on applying JavaScript fundamentals in a practical and realistic context.
